NAME
    MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::Class::BetterAnonClassNames - Metaclass trait to
    *attempt* to demystify generated anonymous class names

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002002 of
    MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::Class::BetterAnonClassNames - released November
    12, 2014 as part of MooseX-TraitFor-Meta-Class-BetterAnonClassNames.

ATTRIBUTES
  is_anon
    Read-only, Boolean, default: false.

    Provides an attribute in the place of "is_anon" in Class::MOP::Package.

  anon_package_prefix
    Read-only, String

METHODS
  _build_anon_package_prefix
    Builder method for the "anon_package_prefix" attribute.

  _anon_package_middle
    Defines what the "middle" of our anonymous package names is; provided
    for ease of overriding and hardcoded to:

        ::__ANON__::SERIAL::

  _anon_package_prefix
    Returns the full prefix used to generate anonymous package names; if
    called on an instance then returns a sensible prefix (generally class
    name) stashed in "anon_package_prefix"; otherwise returns the result of
    a call to "_anon_package_prefix" in Moose::Meta::Class.

  create
    Set the package name to a nicer anonymous class name if is_anon is
    passed and true and anon_package_prefix is passed and a non-empty
    string.

  create_anon_class
    Create an anonymous class, as via "create_anon_class" in
    Moose::Meta::Class, but with a kinder, gentler package name -- if
    possible.

SUMMARY
    You really want to be looking at "with_traits" in MooseX::Util.
